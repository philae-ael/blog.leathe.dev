{: .todo }

Page 47 there is a paragraph named << Recursive Computation of Taylor Coefficients >>. 

It's a cool algorithm i already heard of but I never delved into it. So let's do that.



## Reminders about ODEs

We will deal with ODEs of the form  $$ y'(x) = f(x, y(x)) $$ with $$f$$ analytical. 


> use vector notion and prove that this works in arbitrary dimension, if true

> Give some simple exemples eg. $$exp$$, $$+$$, $$cos$$
