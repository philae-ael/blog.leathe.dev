  abstract = {Work stealing has proven to be an effective method for scheduling fine-grained parallel programs on multicore computers. To achieve high performance, work stealing distributes tasks between concurrent queues, called deques, assigned to each processor. Each processor operates on its deque locally except when performing load balancing via steals. Unfortunately, concurrent deques suffer from two limitations: 1) local deque operations require expensive memory fences in modern weak-memory architectures, 2) they can be very difficult to extend to support various optimizations and flexible forms of task distribution strategies needed many applications, e.g., those that do not fit nicely into the divide-and-conquer, nested data parallel paradigm.},

Although a great deal of research has been directed toward Monte Carlo and finite element methods for solving the rendering equation, little is known about the continuous equation beyond the existence and uniqueness of its solution. The continuous problem may be posed in terms of linear operators acting on infinite-dimensional function spaces. Such operators are fundamentally different from their finite-dimensional counterparts, and are properly studied using the methods of functional analysis. This paper summarizes some of the basic concepts of functional analysis and shows how these concepts may be applied to a linear operator formulation of the rendering equation. In particular, operator norms are obtained from thermodynamic principles, and a number of common function spaces are shown to be closed under global illumination. Finally, several fundamental operators that arise in global illumination are shown to be nearly finite-dimensional in that they can be uniformly approximated by matrices.},

  abstract = {A bounding volume hierarchy (BVH) is a tree structure on a set of geometric objects. All geometric objects, that form the leaf nodes of the tree, are wrapped in bounding volumes. These nodes are then grouped as small sets and enclosed within larger bounding volumes. These, in turn, are also grouped and enclosed within other larger bounding volumes in a recursive fashion, eventually resulting in a tree structure with a single bounding volume at the top of the tree. Bounding volume hierarchies are used to support several operations on sets of geometric objects efficiently, such as in collision detection and ray tracing. Although wrapping objects in bounding volumes and performing collision tests on them before testing the object geometry itself simplifies the tests and can result in significant performance improvements, the same number of pairwise tests between bounding volumes are still being performed. By arranging the bounding volumes into a bounding volume hierarchy, the time complexity (the number of tests performed) can be reduced to logarithmic in the number of objects. With such a hierarchy in place, during collision testing, children volumes do not have to be examined if their parent volumes are not intersected (for example, if the bounding volumes of two bumper cars do not intersect, the bounding volumes of the bumpers themselves would not have to be checked for collision).},

In this paper, we present a simpler and faster technique for wireframe rendering based on texture mapping. Our technique does not require (but can benefit from) graphics hardware programming and thus can be easily integrated to existing rendering engines, while resulting in accurate, high-quality, antialiased, and still versatile, wireframe drawing.}

Flow advection is a close relative of diffusion whose discretized version forms the basis of the popular consensus dynamics. We endeavor to demonstrate in this paper that discretizing the continuous advection equation also forms an attractive set of system dynamics for coordinated control. The key advantage of advection-based algorithms over directed consensus is that the sum of the states is always conserved. This paper includes a formulation of the advection dynamics on directed graphs and a presentation of some of its characteristics, which are compared to the consensus dynamics. We also provide examples of the versatility of the advection dynamics: a formation control and sensor coverage example.}

Incompressibility and particle anti-clustering are enforced with a double density relaxation procedure which updates particle positions according to two opposing pressure terms. From this process surface tension effects emerge, enabling drop and filament formation. Elastic and non-linear plastic effects are obtained by adding springs with varying rest length between particles. We also extend the technique to handle interaction between fluid and dynamic objects. Various simulation scenarios are presented including rain drops, fountains, clay manipulation, and floating objects. The method is robust and stable, and can animate splashing behavior at interactive framerates.},

  abstract = {Efficient scene representations are essential for many computer graphics applications. A general unified representation that can handle both surfaces and volumes simultaneously, remains a research challenge. Inspired by recent methods for scene reconstruction that leverage mixtures of 3D Gaussians to model radiance fields, we formalize and generalize the modeling of scattering and emissive media using mixtures of simple kernel-based volumetric primitives. We introduce closed-form solutions for transmittance and free-flight distance sampling for different kernels, and propose several optimizations to use our method efficiently within any off-the-shelf volumetric path tracer. We demonstrate our method as a compact and efficient alternative to other forms of volume modeling for forward and inverse rendering of scattering media. Furthermore, we adapt and showcase our method in radiance field optimization and rendering, providing additional flexibility compared to current state of the art given its ray-tracing formulation. We also introduce the Epanechnikov kernel and demonstrate its potential as an efficient alternative to the traditionally-used Gaussian kernel in scene reconstruction tasks. The versatility and physically-based nature of our approach allows us to go beyond radiance fields and bring to kernel-based modeling and rendering any path-tracing enabled functionality such as scattering, relighting and complex camera models.},

It is achieved with the help of specific encoding of information. The process of reducing the size of a data file is popularly referred to as data compression, In computer science and information theory, data compression, source coding, or bit-rate reduction is the process of encoding digital information using fewer bits than the original representation. Specifically, digital-image compression is important due to the high storage and transmission requirements. Various compression methods have been proposed using different techniques to achieve high compression ratios. Fractal image encoding is a technique based on the representation of an image by contractive transformations. Fractal-based image compression methods belong to different categories according to the different theories they are based on. In this article, first we try to clarify the terminology used and then to comprehensively unveil the mathematical principle behind fractal image compression as well as to briefly overview a variety of schemes that have been investigated.},

We present hierarchical, mixed radix FFT algorithms for both power-of-two and non-power-of-two sizes. Our hierarchical FFT algorithms efficiently exploit shared memory on GPUs using a Stockham formulation. We reduce the memory transpose overheads in hierarchical algorithms by combining the transposes into a blockbased multi-FFT algorithm. For non-power-of-two sizes, we use a combination of mixed radix FFTs of small primes and Bluestein’s algorithm. We use modular arithmetic in Bluestein’s algorithm to improve the accuracy. We implemented our algorithms using the NVIDIA CUDA API and compared their performance with NVIDIA’s CUFFT library and an optimized CPU-implementation (Intel’s MKL) on a high-end quad-core CPU. On an NVIDIA GPU, we obtained performance of up to 300 GFlops, with typical performance improvements of 2–4× over CUFFT and 8–40× improvement over MKL for large sizes.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we show that applying a linear transformation---represented by a 3 x 3 matrix---to the direction vectors of a spherical distribution yields another spherical distribution, for which we derive a closed-form expression. With this idea, we can use any spherical distribution as a base shape to create a new family of spherical distributions with parametric roughness, elliptic anisotropy and skewness. If the original distribution has an analytic expression, normalization, integration over spherical polygons, and importance sampling, then these properties are inherited by the linearly transformed distributions. By choosing a clamped cosine for the original distribution we obtain a family of distributions, which we call Linearly Transformed Cosines (LTCs), that provide a good approximation to physically based BRDFs and that can be analytically integrated over arbitrary spherical polygons. We show how to use these properties in a realtime polygonal-light shading application. Our technique is robust, fast, accurate and simple to implement.},

Some of the new features include local contrast analysis for more reliable edge detection, and a simple and effective way to handle sharp geometric features and diagonal lines. This, along with our accelerated and accurate pattern classification allows for a better reconstruction of silhouettes. Our method shows for the first time how to combine morphological antialiasing (MLAA) with additional multi/supersampling strategies (MSAA, SSAA) for accurate subpixel features, and how to couple it with temporal reprojection; always preserving the sharpness of the image. All these solutions combine synergies making for a very robust technique, yielding results of better overall quality than previous approaches while more closely converging to MSAA/SSAA references but maintaining extremely fast execution times. Additionally, we propose different presets to better fit the available resources or particular needs of each scenario.},

  abstract = {In mathematics, the Johnson–Lindenstrauss lemma is a result named after William B. Johnson and Joram Lindenstrauss concerning low-distortion embeddings of points from high-dimensional into low-dimensional Euclidean space. The lemma states that a set of points in a high-dimensional space can be embedded into a space of much lower dimension in such a way that distances between the points are nearly preserved. In the classical proof of the lemma, the embedding is a random orthogonal projection. The lemma has applications in compressed sensing, manifold learning, dimensionality reduction, and graph embedding. Much of the data stored and manipulated on computers, including text and images, can be represented as points in a high-dimensional space (see vector space model for the case of text). However, the essential algorithms for working with such data tend to become bogged down very quickly as dimension increases.  It is therefore desirable to reduce the dimensionality of the data in a way that preserves its relevant structure. The Johnson–Lindenstrauss lemma is a classic result in this vein. Also, the lemma is tight up to a constant factor, i.e. there exists a set of points of size m that needs dimension                        Ω                    (                                                        log                 ⁡                 (                 m                 )                                               ε                                    2                                                                   )                          \{\textbackslash displaystyle \textbackslash Omega \textbackslash left(\{\textbackslash frac \{\textbackslash log(m)\}\{\textbackslash varepsilon \textasciicircum\{2\}\}\}\textbackslash right)\}    in order to preserve the distances between all pairs of points within a factor of                         (         1         ±         ε         )                 \{\textbackslash displaystyle (1\textbackslash pm \textbackslash varepsilon )\}    .},

Differentiable rendering is a novel field which allows the gradients of 3D objects to be calculated and propagated through images. It also reduces the requirement of 3D data collection and annotation, while enabling higher success rate in various applications.

  abstract = {Radiance Field methods have recently revolutionized novel-view synthesis of scenes captured with multiple photos or videos. However, achieving high visual quality still requires neural networks that are costly to train and render, while recent faster methods inevitably trade off speed for quality. For unbounded and complete scenes (rather than isolated objects) and 1080p resolution rendering, no current method can achieve real-time display rates. We introduce three key elements that allow us to achieve state-of-the-art visual quality while maintaining competitive training times and importantly allow high-quality real-time (≥ 30 fps) novel-view synthesis at 1080p resolution. First, starting from sparse points produced during camera calibration, we represent the scene with 3D Gaussians that preserve desirable properties of continuous volumetric radiance fields for scene optimization while avoiding unnecessary computation in empty space; Second, we perform interleaved optimization/density control of the 3D Gaussians, notably optimizing anisotropic covariance to achieve an accurate representation of the scene; Third, we develop a fast visibility-aware rendering algorithm that supports anisotropic splatting and both accelerates training and allows realtime rendering. We demonstrate state-of-the-art visual quality and real-time rendering on several established datasets.},

Point sampled objects do neither have to store nor to maintain globally consistent topological information. Therefore they are more flexible compared to triangle meshes when it comes to handling highly complex or dynamically changing shapes. In this paper, we make an attempt to give an overview of the various point-based methods that have been proposed over the last years. In particular we review and evaluate different shape representations, geometric algorithms, and rendering methods which use points as a universal graphics primitive.},

A popular approach for exploiting software parallelism on parallel hardware is task parallelism, where the programmer explicitly identifies potential parallelism and the runtime then schedules the work. Work-stealing is a promising scheduling strategy that a runtime may use to keep otherwise idle hardware busy while relieving overloaded hardware of its burden. However, work-stealing comes with substantial overheads. Recent work identified sequential overheads of work-stealing, those that occur even when no stealing takes place, as a significant source of overhead. That work was able to reduce sequential overheads to just 15\% [21].},

This state-of-the-art report is motivated by the inherent importance of noise in graphics, the widespread use of noise in industry, and the fact that many recent research developments justify the need for an up-to-date survey. Our goal is to provide both a valuable entry point into the field of procedural noise functions, as well as a comprehensive view of the field to the informed reader. In this report, we cover procedural noise functions in all their aspects. We outline recent advances in research on this topic, discussing and comparing recent and well established methods. We first formally define procedural noise functions based on stochastic processes and then classify and review existing procedural noise functions. We discuss how procedural noise functions are used for modeling and how they are applied on surfaces. We then introduce analysis tools and apply them to evaluate and compare the major approaches to noise generation. We finally identify several directions for future work.},

Prefetching, in both hardware and software, is among our most important available techniques for doing so; yet, we claim that prefetching is perhaps also the least well-understood.             Thus, the goal of this study is to develop a novel, foundational understanding of both the benefits and limitations of hardware and software prefetching. Our study includes: source code-level analysis, to help in understanding the practical strengths and weaknesses of compiler- and software-based prefetching; a study of the synergistic and antagonistic effects between software and hardware prefetching; and an evaluation of hardware prefetching training policies in the presence of software prefetching requests. We use both simulation and measurement on real systems. We find, for instance, that although there are many opportunities for compilers to prefetch much more aggressively than they currently do, there is also a tangible risk of interference with training existing hardware prefetching mechanisms. Taken together, our observations suggest new research directions for cooperative hardware/software prefetching.},

After the input mesh is voxelized, we create 8 PBD particles which are constrained to approximate each voxel. Breakable face-to-face constraints between voxels, which are also based on Gram-Schmidt, are created for pairs of neighboring voxels. The regular voxel grid allows efficient parallel processing in a compute shader using Gauss-Seidel iterations with only 1 voxel constraint partition and 3 face constraint partitions. This allows us to minimize the number of compute shader dispatches and memory barriers per frame. Destruction is achieved by disabling face-to-face voxel constraints when the strain limit is exceeded. Anisotropic materials can be created by setting different strain limits on x-, y-, and z- faces. This allows meshes to be peeled into sheets, shredded into strips, or fractured into voxels.},

  abstract = {We have developed a novel hierarchical data structure for the efficient representation of sparse, time-varying volumetric data discretized on a 3D grid. Our “VDB”, so named because it is a Volumetric, Dynamic grid that shares several characteristics with B+trees, exploits spatial coherency of time-varying data to separately and compactly encode data values and grid topology. VDB models a virtually infinite 3D index space that allows for cache-coherent and fast data access into sparse volumes of high resolution. It imposes no topology restrictions on the sparsity of the volumetric data, and it supports fast (average               O               (1)) random access patterns when the data are inserted, retrieved, or deleted. This is in contrast to most existing sparse volumetric data structures, which assume either static or manifold topology and require specific data access patterns to compensate for slow random access. Since the VDB data structure is fundamentally hierarchical, it also facilitates adaptive grid sampling, and the inherent acceleration structure leads to fast algorithms that are well-suited for simulations. As such, VDB has proven useful for several applications that call for large, sparse, animated volumes, for example, level set dynamics and cloud modeling. In this article, we showcase some of these algorithms and compare VDB with existing, state-of-the-art data structures.},

The revised construction and proof provide a framework in which similar constructions may be brought up and their security can be easily proved.

  abstract = {Surface elements (surfels) are a powerful paradigm to efficiently render complex geometric objects at interactive frame rates. Unlike classical surface discretizations, i.e., triangles or quadrilateral meshes, surfels are point primitives without explicit connectivity. Surfel attributes comprise depth, texture color, normal, and others. As a pre-process, an octree-based surfel representation of a geometric object is computed. During sampling, surfel positions and normals are optionally perturbed, and different levels of texture colors are prefiltered and stored per surfel. During rendering, a hierarchical forward warping algorithm projects surfels to a z-buffer. A novel method called visibility splatting determines visible surfels and holes in the z-buffer. Visible surfels are shaded using texture filtering, Phong illumination, and environment mapping using per-surfel normals. Several methods of image reconstruction, including supersampling, offer flexible speed-quality tradeoffs. Due to the simplicity of the operations, the surfel rendering pipeline is amenable for hardware implementation. Surfel objects offer complex shape, low rendering cost and high image quality, which makes them specifically suited for low-cost, real-time graphics, such as games.},

  abstract = {Physically plausible illumination at real-time framerates is often achieved using approximations. One popular example is ambient occlusion (AO), for which very simple and efficient implementations are used extensively in production. Recent methods approximate AO between nearby geometry in screen space (SSAO). The key observation described in this paper is, that screen-space occlusion methods can be used to compute many more types of effects than just occlusion, such as directional shadows and indirect color bleeding. The proposed generalization has only a small overhead compared to classic SSAO, approximates direct and one-bounce light transport in screen space, can be combined with other methods that simulate transport for macro structures and is visually equivalent to SSAO in the worst case without introducing new artifacts. Since our method works in screen space, it does not depend on the geometric complexity. Plausible directional occlusion and indirect lighting effects can be displayed for large and fully dynamic scenes at real-time frame rates.},

  abstract = {Stochastic geometry models have enjoyed immense success in graphics for modeling interactions of light with complex phenomena such as participating media, rough surfaces, fibers, and more. Although each of these models operates on the same principle of replacing intricate geometry by a random process and deriving the average light transport across all instances thereof, they are each tailored to one specific application and are fundamentally distinct. Each type of stochastic geometry present in the scene is firmly encapsulated in its own appearance model, with its own statistics and light transport average, and no cross-talk between different models or deterministic and stochastic geometry is possible.In this paper, we derive a theory of light transport on stochastic implicit surfaces, a geometry model capable of expressing deterministic geometry, microfacet surfaces, participating media, and an exciting new continuum in between containing aggregate appearance, non-classical media, and more. Our model naturally supports spatial correlations, missing from most existing stochastic models.Our theory paves the way for tractable rendering of scenes in which all geometry is described by the same stochastic model, while leaving ample future work for developing efficient sampling and rendering algorithms.}

Tetrahedral meshes are commonly used to represent volumetric deformable models and the presented algorithm is integrated in a physically–based environment, which can be used in game engines and surgical simulators. The proposed algorithm employs a hash function for compressing a potentially infinite regular spatial grid. Although the hash function does not always provide a unique mapping of grid cells, it can be generated very efficiently and does not require complex data structures, such as octrees or BSPs. We have investigated and optimized the parameters of the collision detection algorithm, such as hash function, hash table size and spatial cell size. The algorithm can detect collisions and self–collisions in environments of up to 20k tetrahedrons in real–time. Although the algorithm works with tetrahedral meshes, it can be easily adapted to other object primitives, such as triangles.},

Applications in rendering include distribution ray tracing, Monte Carlo path tracing, and form-factor computation for radiosity methods. In these cases variance can often be significantly reduced by drawing samples from several distributions, each designed to sample well some difficult aspect of the integrand. Normally this is done by explicitly partitioning the integration domain into regions that are sampled differently. We present a powerful alternative for constructing robust Monte Carlo estimators, by combining samples from several distributions in a way that is provably good. These estimators are unbiased, and can reduce variance significantly at little additional cost. We present experiments and measurements from several areas in rendering: calculation of glossy highlights from area light sources, the “final gather” pass of some radiosity algorithms, and direct solution of the rendering equation using bidirectional path tracing.},

However, producing sample sets with desired efficiency and blue noise statistics has been a major challenge, as existing methods are either sequential with limited speed, or are parallel but only through pre-computed datasets and thus fall short in producing samples with blue noise statistics. We present a Poisson disk sampling algorithm that runs in parallel and produces all samples on the fly with desired blue noise properties. Our main idea is to subdivide the sample domain into grid cells and we draw samples concurrently from multiple cells that are sufficiently far apart so that their samples cannot conflict one another. We present a parallel implementation of our algorithm running on a GPU with constant cost per sample and constant number of computation passes for a target number of samples. Our algorithm also works in arbitrary dimension, and allows adaptive sampling from a user-specified importance field. Furthermore, our algorithm is simple and easy to implement, and runs faster than existing techniques.}

In a simplified form, this information is stored in a tree of “rays” extending from the viewer to the first surface encountered and from there to other surfaces and to the light sources. A visible surface algorithm creates this tree for each pixel of the display and passes it to the shader. The shader then traverses the tree to determine the intensity of the light received by the viewer. Consideration of all of these factors allows the shader to accurately simulate true reflection, shadows, and refraction, as well as the effects simulated by conventional shaders. Anti-aliasing is included as an integral part of the visibility calculations. Surfaces displayed include curved as well as polygonal surfaces.},

The approach differs from existing solutions in that a large emphasis is put on allowing the user to edit and stream large datasets. Previous solutions often use compression schemes involving hierarchical data layouts such as sparse voxel octrees that require some form of preprocessing, which prevents efficient editing. By keeping data in raw format we avoid having to preprocess the data making it directly editable. We allow for efficient storage of large empty spaces using a system of layered grids . Our results show our solution has competitive rendering performance and memory usage and allows fast and easy access to the data. Along with the raytracing algorithm and datastructure an occlusion based streaming system is presented. Our system also includes an easy interface for editing voxels. Furthermore, we support streaming from disk and basic level of detail. Combining these features we are able to render and edit potentially infinite landscapes while using a finite amount of memory.},

This survey provides a systematic overview of this technique. We first review the history of TAA, its development path and related work. We then identify the two main sub-components of TAA, sample accumulation and history validation, and discuss algorithmic and implementation options. As temporal upsampling is becoming increasingly relevant to today's game engines, we propose an extension of our TAA formulation to cover a variety of temporal upsampling techniques. Despite the popularity of TAA, there are still significant unresolved technical challenges that affect image quality in many scenarios. We provide an in-depth analysis of these challenges, and review existing techniques for improvements. Finally, we summarize popular algorithms and topics that are closely related to TAA. We believe the rapid advances in those areas may either benefit from or feedback into TAA research and development.},

We introduce a greedy sample elimination algorithm that assigns a weight to each sample in a given set and eliminates the ones with greater weights in order to pick a subset of a desired size with Poisson disk property without having to specify a Poisson disk radius. This new algorithm is simple, computationally efficient, and it can work in any sampling domain, producing sample sets with more pronounced blue noise characteristics than dart throwing. Most importantly, it allows unbiased progressive (adaptive) sampling and it scales better to high dimensions than previous methods. However, it cannot guarantee maximal coverage. We provide a statistical analysis of our algorithm in 2D and higher dimensions as well as results from our tests with different example applications.},

  abstract = {Discontinuous visibility changes remain a major bottleneck when optimizing surfaces within a physically-based inverse renderer. Many previous works have proposed sophisticated algorithms and data structures to sample visibility silhouettes more efficiently. Our work presents another solution: instead of differentiating a tentative surface locally, we differentiate a volumetric perturbation of a surface. We refer this as a many-worlds representation because it models a non-interacting superposition of conflicting explanations (worlds) of the input dataset. Each world is optically isolated from others, leading to a new transport law that distinguishes our method from prior work based on exponential random media. The resulting Monte Carlo algorithm is simpler and more efficient than prior methods. We demonstrate that our method promotes rapid convergence, both in terms of the total iteration count and the cost per iteration.},
